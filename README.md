# Clipboard-Translator-with-Hotkeys
A python project i was interested in doing for in-Game chat (League of Legends). Basically u press a hot key and the selected text gets translated.
The hotkeys are set as follows ctrl + t allows u to translate a text to a certain language of your chosing where as alt + t translates it back to the default language (in my case its arabic) and as a handy plus it shows u the original language of the text so if u want to communicate back all u have to do is remember the original language and type ur reply in the following format:
original language//Hello world!
than copy it, paste it and send it.
